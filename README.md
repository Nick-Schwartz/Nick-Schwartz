<h2>👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

- <b>✅ On-Prem Cyber Lab (2023)</b>
   - In my home cyber lab, I've created a tailored cybersecurity testing environment, connecting vulnerable devices to a guest network. Using Parrot Security OS on a laptop, I actively practice ethical hacking, conduct in-depth data analysis, and continuously patch vulnerabilities, contributing to my cybersecurity expertise. 
- <b>✅ Cloud Cyber Lab (2023)</b>
   - In my cloud hacking lab, I've created a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing, deploying vulnerable virtual machines hosted in the cloud. Using Kali Linux, I practice ethical hacking, conduct in-depth data analysis, and actively patch vulnerabilities, ensuring hands-on learning for securing cloud-based systems. </b></i>
- <b>✅ Fortified Home Network (2024)</b>
   - Securing my home network, I've implemented robust measures with pfSense software on a configured router. This includes firewall, DHCP, DNS, VLAN, and VPN rules. Regular scans ensure a resilient and reliable network.
