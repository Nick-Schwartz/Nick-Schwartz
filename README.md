- <b>‚úÖ Elastic SIEM Home Lab (2024)</b>
   - In this guide, I set up a home lab using Elastic SIEM and a Parrot Security OS Laptop. I forwarded data from the Parrot OS device to SIEM using Elastic Beats agent, generated security events on the Parrot OS laptop and also pulled log data from the router, and analyzed the logs in the SIEM using the Elastic web interface. I also created a dashboard to visualize security events and then created an alert to detect security events, which will be sent to my web domain email address. This home lab provides a valuable environment for learning and practicing the skills necessary for effective security monitoring and incident response using Elastic SIEM. Through these steps, I gained hands-on experience with using a SIEM and improved my security monitoring skills.
- <b>‚úÖ Fortified Home Network (2024)</b>
   - Securing my home network, I've implemented robust measures with pfSense software on a configured router. This includes firewall, DHCP, DNS, VLAN, and VPN rules. Regular scans ensure a resilient and reliable network.
- <b>‚úÖ On-Prem Cyber Lab (2023)</b>
   - In my home cyber lab, I've created a tailored cybersecurity testing environment, connecting vulnerable devices to a guest network. Using Parrot Security OS on a laptop, I actively practice ethical hacking, conduct in-depth data analysis, and continuously patch vulnerabilities, contributing to my cybersecurity expertise. 
- <b>‚úÖ Cloud Cyber Lab (2023)</b>
   - In my cloud hacking lab, I've created a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing, deploying vulnerable virtual machines hosted in the cloud. Using Kali Linux, I practice ethical hacking, conduct in-depth data analysis, and actively patch vulnerabilities, ensuring hands-on learning for securing cloud-based systems. </b></i>

- <b>Home Wi-Fi Segmentation</b>
   - Building out additional VLANs for segmenting off IoT devices at home that I do not trust (i.e., Ring camera, Amazon Alexa (Echo), Firestick, etc.).
